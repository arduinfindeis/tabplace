# TabPlace

**Problem:** In the current situation physical separation between work and leisure has become difficult. Many of us sleep, eat, work and play under the same roof. This situation can be mentally challenging, thereby limiting productivity and wellbeing.

**Solution:** *TabPlace* is a chrome extension that reminds the user at each new tab which place they are in: whether at *work*, *home* or elsewhere. Our hope is that this small but persistent change will improve users' felt work/home separation, improving both productivity and wellbeing.

## Installation

The current prototype can be easily installed. First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/arduinfindeis/tabplace.git
```

Next install the [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/) extension for your chrome browser and set the `index.html` file as the new tab redirect URL in the extension settings. Done, ready to go!
